# Quantum Algorithms for Hamiltonian Simulation
# Prerequisites
- numpy
- qiskit (9/28/2019 Do NOT use the latest version of qiskit (0.12.0). It has a critical bug with unitary operations. 0.11.2 works properly so please use it.) 
- scipy (Not necessary. Only for test codes)

# Features
- Efficient Hamiltonian simulation algorithms for lattice field theory and quantum few body dynamics. 
- Optimized fermion-pauli transformation and quantum circuit compiler.
